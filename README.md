# flipper_lib
A collection of [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) files that can be used to emulate signals of various types.

## File Structure
Files are organized into directories according to the modality they were captured in (e.g., `Sub-GHz`, `NFC`, etc.), the type of device, and the specific model.  

For example:

```bash
.
└── Modality/
    └── Type/
        └── Model/Device
```
